Background and Context
There exists a need for a simple sculpture generator for students who lack the time or inclination to design and CAD/model a 3D object to practice fabrication techniques such as 3D printing.  Thus, we hope in this project to design a program that will take in simple user input such as basic shapes and animations and use it to quickly generate a 3D object.  It will then render that 3D object as an STL file that can be exported to a 3D printer or other fabrication device.  This program presents three main compartments to implement: 
1.) A program that can generate points in 3D space that we can then use to create a 3D object
2.) a program that can take the data generated by our 3D point generator and render it as an STL file
3.) A user interface that can take in simple content such as shapes and animations and convert that content into data that our 3D point generator can use in the generation process.

Key questions
Technical Discussion Questions:
	- Discuss the two different ways we have ideated to generate shapes, pros, cons
		- vector animations to STL
		- random noise contours to STL
- What are other ways we could generate STLs?
- What platform in python is best suited to a user interface? Pros, cons
	-FLASK?
	-PyGame?
	-Others?
Ideation Session
- What valuable functions might this user interface have? (sticky notes)
