Background and Context
There exists a need for a simple sculpture generator for students who lack the time or inclination to design and CAD/model a 3D object to practice fabrication techniques such as 3D printing.  Thus, we hope in this project to design a program that will take in simple user input such as basic shapes and animations and use it to quickly generate a 3D object.  It will then render that 3D object as an STL file that can be exported to a 3D printer or other fabrication device.  

This program presents three main compartments to implement: 
- A program that can generate points in 3D space that we can then use to create a 3D object
- a program that can take the data generated by our 3D point generator and render it as an STL file
- A user interface that can take in simple content such as shapes and animations and convert that content into data that our 3D point generator can use in the generation process.

Key questions
Technical Discussion Questions:
- Discuss the two different ways we have ideated to generate shapes, pros, cons
    - vector animations to STL
        - Create a scaffolding for defining shapes on coordinate axes (points, polygons, squares, rectangles, circles, etc.)
        - Define transformations that can be applied to these shapes over time (rotations, translations, dilations, etc)
        - Apply these transformations in small pieces over time; i.e. do a 90 degree rotation as 90 1 degree rotations
        - This allows for simple vector animations
    - random noise contours to STL
    - Both ideas yield a list of lists of points, where each list of points defines the shape/shapes for the current "frame". We'd then use the frames and the relationships between them to generate an STL.
- What way should we generate STLs?
    - Our current plan is to use OpenSCAD and SolidPython
        - OpenSCAD is a CAD program where you build models with code
        - SolidPython is a Python library to allow you to generate OpenSCAD code with Python code
        - We'd use a single "frame" of our animation (one list of points that define a shape) to define a polygon in OpenSCAD, extrude that polygon up a small distance, then move our plane up a small distance and repeat.
        - This would yield a stack of small extruded shapes, which we could then join together and export as an STL from OpenSCAD
    - Other options:
        - Generate our own STLs
            - This has some interesting and difficult math and geometry problems, but it would teach us quite a bit about lower level programming
        - Interface with Blender
            - We haven't looked into this as much, but Blender might afford us more tools to make the shapes we generate more appealing.
    - Ideas?
- What platform in python is best suited to a user interface? Pros, cons? We know next to nothing about UI design, so any input would be valuable.
    - FLASK? Should this be a web app?
    - PyGame?
    - Others?
    
Ideation Session
- What valuable functions might this user interface have? (sticky notes)
- How can we generate interesting and compelling shapes from simple inputs?
- How can we combine organic and geometric forms? Should we?
