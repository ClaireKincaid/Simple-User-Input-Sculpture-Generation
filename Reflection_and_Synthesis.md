#Feedback and decisions
**Based upon your notes from the technical review, synthesize the feedback you received addressing your key questions. How do you plan to incorporate it going forward? What new questions did you generate?**

We first asked about what we should use for a web-based app, and the feedback that we received was that it is possible, but would make our project much more difficult. We then incorporated this feedback by no longer pursuing a web app, but instead are simply writing a series of python scripts. We also asked about what our user interface should be, and we got ideas ranging from drawing in ms-paint as an input, to local audio noise. Our decision is that we start with the simple drawing-based input, and once we get that working, we plan on moving to more complicated inputs. We asked about how to render in 3d, and received the response pyglet and opengl, which we are now using. 

We also asked about what our interface should accomplish, and it was mentioned that the user should watch as their inputs change the sculpture in real time. This turns out to be quite difficult because of the nature of 3 dimensional matrices, and we have not yet come up with a solution that allows for real time visualization. 

#Review process reflection
**How did the review go? Did you get answers to your key questions? Did you provide too much/too little context for your audience? Did you stick closely to your planned agenda, or did you discover new things during the discussion that made you change your plans? What could you do next time to have an even more effective technical review?**

We thought that we as presenters could have summarized our project more concisely, practiced more, and created a powerpoint instead of handing out papers. We had to dynamically change our agenda, because we realized that the audience didn’t have enough context to answer “what user interface should we have?” That stumble caused some improvisation, and could have been better planned if we had given a practice presentation to a small audience.

Despite all of that we received valuable feedback on our major questions. We are incorporating most of the solutions we received into our development. Some of the suggestions are going to be a lot more difficult to implement than our previous idea, but we believe that they will result in a much stronger final product.
